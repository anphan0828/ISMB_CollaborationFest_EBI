## Title: Structural and Functional Characterization of Human RecQ4 Helicase

Core Molecular Function

RecQ4 unwinds double-stranded DNA in a 3' to 5' direction through ATP hydrolysis, but operates via a distinct mechanism compared to other human RecQ helicases. It can separate DNA substrates with short duplex regions (up to ~18 base pairs) but is relatively weak and non-processive compared to other RecQ family members.

Key Structural Features:
- Novel R4ZBD Domain: Instead of the canonical RQC domain found in other RecQ helicases, RecQ4 contains a unique zinc-binding domain (R4ZBD) with two winged-helix motifs positioned adjacent to the first helicase domain (HD1)
- Conserved ATPase Core: Contains the typical SF2 helicase domains (HD1 and HD2) with a functional aromatic-rich loop (ARL) that couples DNA binding to ATP hydrolysis
- Critical C-terminus: The last 92 amino acids (CTD) significantly enhance DNA binding affinity (~4-fold) and helicase activity (~5-fold)

DNA Binding Properties:
- Binds single-stranded DNA with low nanomolar affinity (Kd ~4.6 nM for the full-length construct)
- The ARL functions as a DNA sensor, recognizing ssDNA binding and enabling ATP hydrolysis
-DNA binding occurs across the ATPase domain surface, similar to other RecQ helicases

Unique Mechanism

Unlike other human RecQ helicases that use a Î²-hairpin wedge for strand separation, RecQ4 likely employs a mechanism more similar to bacterial RecQ helicases, potentially involving critical DNA bending angles rather than physical strand separation elements.
