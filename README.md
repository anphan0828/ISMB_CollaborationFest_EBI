## Enhancing Protein Knowledge Curation using Gene Ontology Annotations and Large Language Models for Community Literature Submissions

Participants are invited to use their preferred tools and technologies to assist in protein knowledge extraction from scientific publications submitted to UniProt by the research community.

### Tutorial time:
Wednesday, July 23th, beginning of Collaboration Fest

### Background
Data-driven biomedical discovery depends on effective data curation - a time consuming process that involves identifying relevant literature, extracting experimental knowledge, and validating information into structured formats suitable for databases like UniProt. 

The emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to assist human-driven data curation workflows. These technologies can support curators in searching ontologies and extracting knowledge from scientific literature, potentially streamlining the entire curation process.

### Objective
Learn how to manually assign GO terms or develop innovative approaches using LLM tools to enhance the curation workflow, enabling efficient and accurate extraction of experimental data from scientific literature. Target outputs include:

*  Gene Ontology (GO) terms
*  Scientific summaries highlighting key findings
*  Experimental data in UniProt line-type format covering protein function, catalytic activity, subcellular location, and protein-protein interactions

### Dataset
Participants will receive a curated dataset of publications submitted by the UniProt community.

### Suggested Approach
Consider exploring these approaches to enhance knowledge extraction:

*  GO Term Assignment: Assign Gene Ontology (GO) terms to gene products based on literature evidence, following GO Consortium guidelines. This can be by manual annotation, and we will be giving a tutorial on this, or by the use of public domain LLM tools  to automate or assist in creating GOA (Gene Ontology Annotation) workflows.
*  Knowledge Mining: Apply text-mining and LLM technologies to extract specific information from scientific literature, including protein functional descriptions, catalytic activities, and other relevant experimental data.
*  Literature Summarization: Utilize LLM capabilities to generate concise, accurate summaries of scientific publications that highlight the most significant findings and their implications for protein research.
